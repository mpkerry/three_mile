                        The camp <a class="js-scroll-trigger" href="#summer-reservations">
                        summer season</a> is nine weeks long, and there are 4
                        <a class="js-scroll-trigger" href="reservations.html#fall-reservations">fall weekends</a>.
                         The maximum stay is normally two weeks; an optional third week may be
                        requested after all two-week reservations have been accommodated. In addition, there are a few
                        off-season programs, including a <a href="http://www.milesofmusiccamp.com/" target="_blank">music camp</a>
                        and 2 <a href="http://carolfaulkneryoga.com/retreats.html" target="_blank">yoga retreats</a>.
                    </p>
                    <p>No children under the age of four are permitted, and no pets.</p>

                    <h4>How to Send a Reservation Request</h4>
                    <p>To request a reservation you must mail these four items:</p>
                    <ol>
                        <li><strong>Reservation Form</strong> (<a target="_blank" href="docs/2017%20Summer%20Reservation%20Form%20(FINAL)_0.pdf">Summer</a>
                            and/or <a target="_blank" href="docs/2017%20Fall%20Weekend%20Reservation%20Form%20(FINAL).pdf">Fall Weekend</a>).</li>
                        <li><strong>AMC Liability Waiver</strong> (<a target="_blank" href="docs/VMF%20Risk%20and%20Release_2010.pdf">
                            waiver form</a>). Up to six campers may sign on each copy of this form.</li>
                        <li><strong>Deposit</strong> For Summer reservations, $100 per person per week (non-refundable);
                            for Fall Weekends, include full payment. If applicable, Summer and Fall payments should be
                            separate checks. In either case, make the check out to "Three Mile Island A.M.C."
                            <a href="#rates" class="js-scroll-trigger">Prices</a> are listed here.</li>
                        <li><strong>Self-addressed, stamped envelope.</strong></li>
                    </ol>
                    <p>
                        Mail the application to the Registrar at the address below. Have it postmarked between January 1
                        and Febuary 1 to maximize your likelihood of getting a spot during the week/s you prefer (see
                        <a href="#summer-reservations" class="js-scroll-trigger">'Lottery'</a>). If you
                        are requesting both a Fall Weekend and a Summer reservation, they may be submitted in the same
                        envelope, but please include a separate deposit check for each. Once your Summer reservation
                        request is accepted, the deposit is non-refundable unless we are
                        unable to accommodate your request. The Fall Weekend payment may be refunded (minus a $25 processing
                        fee), if the cancellation request is received at least 45 days prior to scheduled arrival.

                    <p>
                        Please indicate preferred launch time with your reservation at the bottom of the form where it
                        says "Arrival Time." Summer launch times are 9:00 AM, noon, 2:00 PM (Saturday ONLY) and 5:00 PM.
                        Fall launch times are normally 5:00 PM and 8:30 PM on Friday and 9:00 AM on Saturday, returning

                        February 1 are welcome, but they will only be considered after all those postmarked between
                        January 1 and February 1 have been processed.
                    </p>

                        Fall weekends are a fantastic way to introduce folks to the magic of Three Mile Island. Many
                        summer campers like to return for a much needed second dose. The atmosphere is relaxed, and the
                        weather is often superb. "Veteran Croo" members who staff the weekends are thrilled to be back on
                        TMI and they bring high levels of enthusiasm.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        The weekends are "quasi full service." The only real differences in the fall are that the lake
                        is less crowded, the island is only open to 60 campers, you carry your own baggage, and you bring
                        your own bedding and towels. It is a great way to take the sting out of the end of another summer.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Each weekend includes three meals on Saturday, breakfast and lunch on Sunday, as well as canoe
                        and sailboat use. Of course, there is an extra day included for the Labor Day weekend. Bring
                        sleeping bags, pillow cases, towels, and flashlights. Children under 4 years of age and pets are
                        not permitted.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The Fall season includes four weekends. You may apply for as many Fall Weekends as you like, whether
                        or not you have also applied for a Summer reservation. The process for Fall reservations coincides
                        with that for Summer reservations (i.e., starting with submissions postmarked January 1—February 1).
                        The Fall Weekends are slower to fill and normally a lottery has been unnecessary, but you are more
                        likely to get your cabin choices if you reserve early.
                    </p>

                        The A.M.C. Three Mile Island Camp launch, the "Appy V", picks up and drops off passengers at the
                        Public Boat landing at Shep Brown's Boat Basin in Meredith, NH. During the summer season, there are
                        scheduled launch times at 9:00 am, 12:00 noon, 2:00 pm (Sat. only), and 5:00 pm. Launch
                        passengers should have reservations on the island or have made previous arrangements with the
                        Summer Manager or Off-Season Manager.

                    <p>
                        In recent summers, the public parking lot at Shep Brown's has been very crowded, particularly on
                        weekends. In an effort to provide enough parking space for TMI campers and staff, and to free up space in
                        the public lot for our neighbors on Bear and Pine Islands, Three Mile Island has purchased land
                        and constructed a fenced parking area near the top of Lovejoy Sands Road. The Three Mile Island
                        parking is on the right side of the road as you head toward the lake, just
                        before the first storage building. If the gate is locked, ask the Launch Driver for the combination.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Please park in the Three Mile Island lot rather than the main public lot. It's only about a
                        three-minute walk to the dock. Handicapped accessible parking continues to be available in the
                        main public lot right in front of the public docks.</p>

                    <p>
                        As you drive down the approach road into the Shep Brown's area, our parking lot is behind a chain
                        link fence just before the first building on the right. (There is a "sandwich board" sign in front
                        of the Three Mile Island parking lot.)
                    </p>

                    <p>If the gate is locked upon your arrival, ask the Launch Driver for the combination.</p>

                    <p>
                        At popular launch times, such as mid-day on Saturdays, a TMI representative may be at the dock
                        with parking lot information.
