                  The Appalachian Mountain Club is supported by the work of thousands of volunteers throughout the country.
                  Three Mile Island Camp depends on the sustained efforts of a volunteer community comprised of hundreds of
                  individuals, who contribute a few hours or weekends each year to keep things humming along. There are
                  numerous <a href="#work-weekends" class="js-scroll-trigger">opportunities</a> throughout the year, including
                  joining the <a href="#committee" class="js-scroll-trigger">volunteer committee</a> that manages the island.
                  Please join us!

              <h5>Spring Opening Weekend</h5>
              <p>       Join us for a weekend of trail repair, handyman projects, and opening camp. Help sweep cobwebs,
                    organize the kitchen, roof a cabin, cook dinner, stain a john, rig a boat, you get the idea. All
                    talents and ages welcome. The more the merrier!<br/>
                    Coordinated by: Dinty Child, offseasonmanager@3mile.org.
              </p>
              <h5>Summer Opportunities</h5>
              <p>
              It's only Tuesday and you've already raced to the end of that bodice-ripper of a romance novel that
                    you thought would last you the week? Twice? Have we got a suggestion for you! Plenty of campers are
                    discovering the fun of pitching in around camp during their summer stays. We're always looking for
                    folks to cane chair seats on the Main Dock, mentor "da Croo" in a variety of skills, select a project
                    from the Summer Managers list, or suggest a contribution of their own.<br/>
                  Coordinated by: Summer Manager, Wilbur Holmes, manager@3mile.org.
              </p>
              <h5>Stonedam Island Check-ups</h5>
               <p>
                   AMC Three Mile Island Camp assists the Lakes Region Conservation Trust with periodic checks on Stonedam
                    Island. Volunteers perform litter patrols and check on trail conditions.<br/>
                    Coordinated by: Wilbur Holmes, manager@3mile.org, during the summer season, or Dinty Child,
                    offseasonmanager@3mile.org, during the spring and fall.
               </p>

              <h5>Five Mile Island Spring Clean-up</h5>
              <p>
                    Five Mile Island was recently acquired by the Lakes Region Conservation Trust. The AMC assists with
                    trail clearing and periodic clean-ups.<br/>
                    Coordinated by: Wilbur Holmes, manager@3mile.org, during the summer season, or Dinty Child,
                    offseasonmanager@3mile.org, during the spring and fall.
              </p>
              <h5>Fall Volunteer Work Week</h5>
              <p>
                    Experience the island in all its Indian Summer splendor with a handful of other volunteers as we
                    turn our handyman skills to odd jobs around camp. Projects range from light carpentry and hardware
                    repair to painting, plumbing, refinishing furniture, you get the idea... Attendance is free and
                    includes all meals and lodging, plus plenty of time for R & R. Attendance limited to 12, so sign up now!<br/>
                    Coordinated by: Stroker Rogovin at (781) 641-2506, or volunteer_info@3mile.org.

              <h5>Fall Closing Weekend</h5>
              <p>
                    Help put camp to bed for the winter. As usual, we'll be packing up the kitchen, bagging mattresses,
                    locking shutters, hauling and storing boats, etc. Same as opening camp, we welcome people of all
                    ages, abilities, and interests. The Three Mile Camp Committee also meets on the Island this weekend,
                    so it's a great chance to catch up on news and get better acquainted with the volunteers and staff
                  that make Three Mile the super place it is.<br/>

                        AMC Three Mile Island Camp is managed by volunteers. The TMI Volunteer "Committee" sets policies
                        and goals for the camp, hires the summer managers and oversees the long-term financial affairs
                        of the Camp. The Committee helps to ensure that Three Mile continues to meet the vision
                        articulated by one of its founders, Roswell Bigelow Lawrence, in October 1900:
                    </p>
                    <blockquote class=" col-lg-10 mx-auto">
                        But not only should the natural beauties of the island be protected and no work of man allowed
                        to mar; but campers also should live as close to nature as the rules of hygiene and reasonable
                        regard to comfort will allow. Golf and fine clothes should be tabooed; early hours, camp costumes,
                        and simple fare should be the rules. Canoeing and swimming, fishing and sailing, tramping and climbing,
                        resting and communing with nature should be the order of every day. Briefly, the island camp
                        should never become a hotel, but remain a camp, pure and simple, where club members may find
                        rest and live as close to nature as possible.

                        Comprised of fourteen members, the Three Mile Island Committee meets formally three times per year,
                        (September, February and May). Committee member terms are four years long, with three new members
                        recruited each year. Volunteering for the Committee is a fun way to help preserve our special
                        island community. If you'd like more information, or would like to apply for the Committee,
                        contact the Chair, Gill King, at committeechair@3mile.org.
