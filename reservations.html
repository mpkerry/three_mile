                        The camp summer season is nine weeks long, and there are 4 fall weekends.
                         The maximum stay is normally two weeks; an optional third week may be
                        requested after all two-week reservations have been accommodated. In addition, there are a few
                        off-season programs, including a <a href="http://www.milesofmusiccamp.com/" target="_blank">music camp</a> and 2 <a href="http://carolfaulkneryoga.com/retreats.html" target="_blank">yoga retreats</a>.

                        February 1 are welcome, but they will only be considered after all those postmarked between

                        The Fall season includes four weekends. You may apply for as many Fall Weekends as you like, whether
                        or not you have also applied for a Summer reservation. The process for Fall reservations coincides
                        with that for Summer reservations (i.e., starting with submissions postmarked January 1â€”February 1).
                        The Fall Weekends are slower to fill and normally a lottery has been unnecessary, but you are more
                        likely to get your cabin choices if you reserve early.

                        The A.M.C. Three Mile Island Camp launch, the "Appy V", picks up and drops off passengers at the
                        Public Boat landing at Shep Brown's Boat Basin in Meredith, NH. During the summer season, there are
                        scheduled launch times at 9:00 am, 12:00 noon, 2:00 pm (Sat. only), and 5:00 pm. Launch
                        passengers should have reservations on the island or have made previous arrangements with the
                        Summer Manager or Off-Season Manager.

                    <p>
                        In recent summers, the public parking lot at Shep Brown's has been very crowded, particularly on
                        weekends. In an effort to provide enough parking space for TMI campers and staff, and to free up space in
                        the public lot for our neighbors on Bear and Pine Islands, Three Mile Island has purchased land
                        and constructed a fenced parking area near the top of Lovejoy Sands Road. The Three Mile Island
                        parking is on the right side of the road as you head toward the lake, just
                        before the first storage building. If the gate is locked, ask the Launch Driver for the combination.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Please park in the Three Mile Island lot rather than the main public lot. It's only about a
                        three-minute walk to the dock. Handicapped accessible parking continues to be available in the
                        main public lot right in front of the public docks.</p>

                            Follow Meredith Neck Road for about 2.5 miles; turn left on Lovejoy Sands Road (follow the
                            signs to "Shep Brown's Boat Basin")

                            The Three Mile Island parking lot (see below) is a short distance down Lovejoy Sands Road on
                            the right. The public boat landing is straight ahead.
                        </li>

                    <h5>Directions to the Three Mile Island Parking Lot</h5>
                    <p>
                        As you drive down the approach road into the Shep Brown's area, our parking lot is behind a chain
                        link fence just before the first building on the right. (There is a "sandwich board" sign in front
                        of the Three Mile Island parking lot.)
                    </p>

                    <p>If the gate is locked upon your arrival, ask the Launch Driver for the combination.</p>

                    <p>
                        At popular launch times, such as mid-day on Saturdays, a TMI representative may be at the dock
                        with parking lot information.
